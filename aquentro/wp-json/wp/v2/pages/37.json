However, you\u2019ll need to pay a small fee for overnight parking for extra $5.<\/p>\n<p><!--more View details--><\/p>\n<p>Both services are offered only in Manhattan, Long Island City and the gentrifying portions of western Brooklyn, as well as both of the city\u2019s major airports.<\/p>\n<p>If these prices don\u2019t seem like a steal, you probably haven\u2019t tried driving in New York City lately. Free street parking can be found during the evening hours, but during the day you can pretty much forget about it, particularly in Midtown Manhattan, where a half-hour stint in a parking structure starts at $12 and hourly rates of $50 or $60 aren\u2019t unheard of.<\/p>\n<p>Pay attention. Things move fast at the vehicle drop-off zone. The valets have an\u00a0efficient\u00a0system in place so that guests can drop off or pick up their cars quickly and easily. You don\u2019t want to be the schmo who throws a wrench in the gears. Be alert for valets directing traffic and follow their lead. Drive into the loading zone safely, slowly, and in the right direction.<\/p>\n<p>Tuck away all your valuables.If you have any valuable items in your car, tuck them away out of sight or put them in the trunk before you arrive at the valet stand. While the vast majority of valets are honest and trustworthy, you never know when you\u2019ll encounter a bad apple.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It\u2019s hard to find a good parking zone or garages in our crowded area, but we managed to do it for you.
