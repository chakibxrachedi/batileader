Interview the actual babysitter yourself and take a look at the facilities to confirm they are clean and safe.<\/p>\n<p>Like hotels, we offer child care or supervised activities for children. With the kids safe and nearby, parents can get some worry-free alone time. We offer lots of options for young kids, teens and tweens. Since some cruises have minimum traveling ages, make sure your little ones are old enough to hop aboard.<\/p>\n<p>Not all families can afford a resort, however, and not all parents can afford or are comfortable turning over responsibility to strangers. Richards has a simple suggestion for families in that situation. Book an apartment with a balcony, so you and your spouse can take a bottle of wine out to the terrace while kids are sleep. This is an inexpensive and easy option for getting at least a little alone time while vacationing with children.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Traveling with little ones?
