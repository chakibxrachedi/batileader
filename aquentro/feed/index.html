										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While Airbnb started in San Francisco and is often associated with a cheap lodging alternatives in major cities, those in rural areas seem to benefit almost equally. The median annual earning for rural hosts was $6,776 in comparison to the $6,674 median for urban hosts. As the balance of the global population has shifted to cities, so have government resources and business capital, causing a widening gap in economic opportunity between urban and rural areas.</p>
<p><span id="more-222"></span></p>
<p>Many rural communities around the world have had little investment by the hotel establishment. In the countryside of France, you can watch home sharing transform the traditional tourist season in real time. Our campaigns to help promote the small villages make us really proud. Staying in rural area, you can holistically help benefit the rural communities our hosts call home and in which our guests increasingly feel they belong.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It can be challenging to stay healthy while traveling for business. You’re likely adjusting to a new time zone, managing a hectic schedule and eating several meals out.</p>
<p><span id="more-220"></span></p>
<p>Here are a few tips to make it easier: stay Hydrated, choose water over alcoholic drinks, pack your own quality snacks and eat often (to avoid expensive shops and not eat poorly), stretch, eat well, walk or bike more often, eat vitamins, take a good sleep and stay active for a long time.</p>
<p>Try to manage to find the time and motivation to work out during a business trip can be difficult. Try getting creative and swimming laps at the hotel pool or asking the concierge to help map out a scenic run. Use popular apps to deal with a usual routine while you are on the road.You can also bring your morning routine with you. Starting the day correctly is important, so stick to the routine you maintain back home when staying in a city for more than a day.</p>

When travelling with someone, sharing a room will be cheaper than booking two separate rooms. If you are travelling in business with someone, we will host you at the best place in the city.To many business travelers, the idea of not staying at a hotel could be considered heretical. The predictability of hotels makes them look solid.</p>

<p>However, in the last few years, one of the fastest growing segments of business travel is home and apartment rentals. Data shows that while the total volume of short-term apartment rentals is still small, it’s growing exponentially. Home and apartment rentals from companies like Airbnb and Homeaway offer millions of listings around the world. Traditionally, these companies have focused on vacationers, but you can also use home rental on business trips. It will get your business trip a homey comfort, less variability in pricing, and more relaxation.</p>

<p><span id="more-216"></span></p>
<p>Tours are comprehensive and you can tip the guide if you enjoyed the tour. If you are looking for more specific experiences, we would recommend taking a look and booking your tours via popular apps. When first arriving in a new city make sure to stop by the tourism bureau for discounts, free maps and cost-free events.</p>
<p>Booking in advance, you can definitely save time and hassle of queuing and skip the line for the Eiffel Tower in Paris or skip the queues for the London Eye! In this case, time is money and a bit of planning can get you a really long and pleasant way! Challenge yourself to think differently about budget travelling.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Apartment rentals are becoming popular as an alternative form of accommodations when you travel around the world these days. We&#8217;ve been lucky enough to stay in all sorts of accommodation over the years from cheap guest houses to five star resorts, and recently had the unique opportunity of staying in both an apartment and a hotel while visiting Venice.</p>
<p><span id="more-214"></span></p>
<p>We thought it would be interesting to compare our experience between our apartment rental and our hotel stay in Venice and give our readers some trip advice so they know which form of accommodation we think is better. At least in Venice anyway.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Whether you’re looking for a secluded location, modern decor, extravagant furnishings, world-class service or a chalet with a twist, our reviews got you covered. We chose the best chalets across the Alps to carry out tried and tested reviews. Each chalet is rated out of 10 in the following categories: style, character, location, service, facilities, rooms, food and value for money to give you an in-depth look into what each property offers.</p>
<p><span id="more-209"></span></p>
<p>We’ll start with Swiss ski resorts that come with chocolate-box appeal, and chalets in popular villages such as Zermatt and Verbier, just like Hillterstone, go a long way to making those picture-perfect ski holiday dreams a reality. Prices in Switzerland might be higher than anywhere else in Europe, but along with the weighty price tags come some of the world’s most luxurious lodgings. Check out our best-in-class chalet in Switzerland to see what we mean.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Traditionally, staying in a ski chalet was rather regimented and in most cases it still is. Wake up bright and early to a huge breakfast, return around four or five to mountains of cakes and hot chocolate before a four or five-course meal in the evening. But not everyone burns can burn calories on the snow each day so a tub of hot cheese, ham and buttery potatoes isn&#8217;t always necessary, but you need to get what you are given.</p>
<p><span id="more-205"></span></p>
<p>And you might fancy trying out that new restaurant in town but the ski chalet staff have been preparing&#8217; since noon. Fortunately things are changing and it&#8217;s now possible to find (though still hard) a more freestyle attitude to dinners and dinner times. Above all, be nice to the staff. Take out things they can&#8217;t get in the Alps as little presents/tips &#8211; the staff will then go out of their way to be extra nice. Why tip at the end? And because of the way the budgets work, it&#8217;s good to get the hosts on side.</p>
