										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It can be challenging to stay healthy while traveling for business. You’re likely adjusting to a new time zone, managing a hectic schedule and eating several meals out.</p>
<p><span id="more-220"></span></p>
<p>Here are a few tips to make it easier: stay Hydrated, choose water over alcoholic drinks, pack your own quality snacks and eat often (to avoid expensive shops and not eat poorly), stretch, eat well, walk or bike more often, eat vitamins, take a good sleep and stay active for a long time.</p>
<p>Try to manage to find the time and motivation to work out during a business trip can be difficult. Try getting creative and swimming laps at the hotel pool or asking the concierge to help map out a scenic run. Use popular apps to deal with a usual routine while you are on the road.You can also bring your morning routine with you. Starting the day correctly is important, so stick to the routine you maintain back home when staying in a city for more than a day.</p>

<p>However, in the last few years, one of the fastest growing segments of business travel is home and apartment rentals. Data shows that while the total volume of short-term apartment rentals is still small, it’s growing exponentially. Home and apartment rentals from companies like Airbnb and Homeaway offer millions of listings around the world. Traditionally, these companies have focused on vacationers, but you can also use home rental on business trips. It will get your business trip a homey comfort, less variability in pricing, and more relaxation.</p>

<p>We’ll start with Swiss ski resorts that come with chocolate-box appeal, and chalets in popular villages such as Zermatt and Verbier, just like Hillterstone, go a long way to making those picture-perfect ski holiday dreams a reality. Prices in Switzerland might be higher than anywhere else in Europe, but along with the weighty price tags come some of the world’s most luxurious lodgings. Check out our best-in-class chalet in Switzerland to see what we mean.</p>
