										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Apartment rentals are becoming popular as an alternative form of accommodations when you travel around the world these days. We&#8217;ve been lucky enough to stay in all sorts of accommodation over the years from cheap guest houses to five star resorts, and recently had the unique opportunity of staying in both an apartment and a hotel while visiting Venice.</p>
<p><span id="more-214"></span></p>
<p>We thought it would be interesting to compare our experience between our apartment rental and our hotel stay in Venice and give our readers some trip advice so they know which form of accommodation we think is better. At least in Venice anyway.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Traditionally, staying in a ski chalet was rather regimented and in most cases it still is. Wake up bright and early to a huge breakfast, return around four or five to mountains of cakes and hot chocolate before a four or five-course meal in the evening. But not everyone burns can burn calories on the snow each day so a tub of hot cheese, ham and buttery potatoes isn&#8217;t always necessary, but you need to get what you are given.</p>
<p><span id="more-205"></span></p>
<p>And you might fancy trying out that new restaurant in town but the ski chalet staff have been preparing&#8217; since noon. Fortunately things are changing and it&#8217;s now possible to find (though still hard) a more freestyle attitude to dinners and dinner times. Above all, be nice to the staff. Take out things they can&#8217;t get in the Alps as little presents/tips &#8211; the staff will then go out of their way to be extra nice. Why tip at the end? And because of the way the budgets work, it&#8217;s good to get the hosts on side.</p>
